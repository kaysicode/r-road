# This R Program will show on how to print and
# what is the syntax in R


# Both are print statement, first you can simply just print without using the
# print(). But in some cases, you need to use the print() when working with
# for loops

"Hi R World!"
print("Hello R World!")

# Notice that, when you clicked the Run, it will only show the "Hi R World!"
# This is because, the Run will always shows the line by line of the program
# even the comments.
# before it moves to the next one. However, if you highlight a code then,
# that code will shows first. 

# If you want to run all of the program, click the Source. But it will only shows the
# output that has print() or cat()

# to clear the console type ctrl + l
